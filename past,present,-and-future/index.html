<h1>Jackie's Past,Present, and Future!</h1>

<h2>My Past</h2>

<p> I was born in Rohnert Park in Sonoma County, California. This city is close to Sacramento and San Francisco. I don't really remember much about my past here besides always going on nature walks with the family. We moved from california when I was 5 or 6, just after I finished kindergraden. I do remember the school I went to which was Monte Vista Elementry School.</p>
